Project Name: LinkyBecky

Create a fullstack, mobile-first Link-in-Bio application inspired by Linktree and closely integrated with a Bitly-like service named LinkyVicky. The app should be built with the exact same stack as LinkyVicky (React.js + Tailwind + TypeScript frontend, Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL backend using Drizzle ORM).

Start with a GitHub reference repo (assume structure, routes, and base UI are imported), but remove redundant features and extend it to include the following core functionalities:

✅ Link Management
- Add/edit/delete multiple personal links
- Automatically shorten URLs by calling the LinkyVicky API
- Display QR codes for each shortened link (LinkyVicky API)
- Add UTM parameters easily via toggle controls
- Drag-and-drop link sorting

✅ AI Integration (ChatGPT API)
- Suggest link titles, descriptions, and CTA copy based on input URL
- Weekly AI performance summary (e.g., "This link is underperforming in Korea")
- Recommend optimal link order or visibility based on CTR

✅ Profile Customization
- Editable mobile-first public profile page at `linkybecky.com/@username`
- Live editor for background color, font, and layout
- Support for YouTube/Spotify embeds
- Social icons and custom domain mapping

✅ Analytics Dashboard
- Display real-time stats by calling LinkyVicky's analytics API
- Show device, region, and browser stats per link
- Track visitor trends over time

✅ Auth & Access
- Login/signup with Google OAuth
- Session-based login with JWT token support
- Logged-in users can access editor, dashboard, and analytics

✅ Extensibility & API Use
- Webhooks/Zapier support (on click events)
- Support Stripe for Pro Plan if extended later
- All backend routes to use Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle

⚙️ Dev Structure
- Monorepo setup using Replit’s Node.js template
- Split `/client` and `/server` folders
- Use `dotenv`, `axios`, `zustand`, and `react-router-dom`
- Replit-ready `.replit` and `replit.nix` files included

Priority: Mobile-first, AI-enhanced UX, and seamless LinkyVicky integration.
